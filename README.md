# frequent-itemsets

This repository contains five python scripts.
It uses the retail dataset from: (http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/retail.dat)
The dependencies for these scripts is matplotlib and numpy.
Each implementation runs the algorithm and graphs it after.

The first is apriori.py. This is an implementation of the apriori algortihm.
The second is pcy.py. This is an implementation of the PCY algorithm.
The third is SON.py. This is an implementation of the SON algorithm.
The fourth is RS.py. This is an implementation of the Random Sampling version of Apriori.
The fifth is graph.py. Which just runs all the implementations and graphs them on a single chart.
