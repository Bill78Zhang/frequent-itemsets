# frequent-itemsets

This repository contains five python scripts.<br/>
It uses the retail dataset from: (http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/retail.dat)<br/>
The dependencies for these scripts is matplotlib and numpy.<br/>
Each implementation runs the algorithm and graphs it after.<br/>

The first is apriori.py. This is an implementation of the apriori algortihm.<br/>
The second is pcy.py. This is an implementation of the PCY algorithm.<br/>
The third is SON.py. This is an implementation of the SON algorithm.<br/>
The fourth is RS.py. This is an implementation of the Random Sampling version of Apriori.<br/>
The fifth is graph.py. Which just runs all the implementations and graphs them on a single chart.<br/>
